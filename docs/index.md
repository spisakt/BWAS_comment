### Summary

- Brain-wise Association Studies (BWAS) correlate individual differences in phenotypic traits with measures of brain structue and function.
- A recent paper by Marek, Tervo-Clemmens (T-C) et al. [evaluated](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04492-9) the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging datasets and came to the general conclusion that *“BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals”*. 
- Marek, T-C, et al. find that multivariate BWAS provide “inflated in-sample associations” that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered) unless thousands of participants are included. This implies that effect size estimates from the discovery sample are necessarily inflated.
- In our 'Matter Arising' commentary, we distinguish between the effect size estimation method (in-sample vs. cross-validated) and the sample (discovery vs. replication), and show that with appropriate cross-validation the in-sample “inflation” Marek, T-C, et al. report in the discovery sample can be entirely eliminated. 
- With additional analyses, we demonstrate that multivariate BWAS effects in high quality datasets can be replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes in many cases. Specifically, with a standard multivariate prediction based on functional connectivity, BWAS is commonly replicable with N=75-500.
